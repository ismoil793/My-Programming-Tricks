A semaphore is a variable used to control access to a shared resource within the operating system, and a mutex is simply a lock acquired before entering a critical section and releasing it. A semaphore is better for multiple instances of a resource, but a mutex is better for a single shared resource.

A Mutex is different than a semaphore as it is a locking mechanism while a semaphore is a signalling mechanism.


Mutex uses object - Semaphore uses integer counter

Mutex locking mechanism is based on acquire() and release()

Seamphore signalling is based on wait() and signal()
